I am a Entrepreneurial Software Developer working in Bengaluru, India. I always want to solve problems with code and make an impact on the customers by making their lives easier. I believe that being a good programmer is not just about knowing the latest languages and frameworks but it is to solutionize the problems using the best available technology and keeping in mind the cost and feasibility.
